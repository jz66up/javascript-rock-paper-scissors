# javascript-rock-paper-scissors

Before my Readme, here is my [Live weblink ](https://jz66up.github.io/javascript-rock-paper-scissors/). This project is about making a well known traditional game into a digitalised version. 

# What i learnt from this project

1. Make an alert popup and to prompt the player 
   
```js 
prompt("Choose a weapon between rock, paper, and scissors");
```

2. using `querySelector` to return the element that matches the specified selector and bringing it into Javascript

3. using `addEventListener()` to call a function whenever an event happens, for example clicking a element as shown below 

```js
rockEl.addEventListener("click", () => {
  playRound("rock")
```

4. the new `if` format in javascript (that is different from other coding languages)

5. the new `else if` condition thats asks another `if` if the first `if` is returned as false

6. when adding 1 to a variable, use `++`

7. In the `if` condition, "and" is written as `&&` and "or" is written as `||`

8. the `disabled` function diables a button

9. `innerText` lets you write text in Javascript

10. `.style.display = "none"` makes an element disappear


# Ideas for future development
After the game is over, I can give the player an option whether to play again, which would reset everything and restart a brand new game.
